/**
 * JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
 * - It's not connected with Javascript object but it's not the same!
 * - Light: ex. XML is heavy - a lot of bytes uses, lot of tags
 * - Only use " " -> for keys also
 * - No comma at the end
 * - Can nested values
 * - Can use strings, ints, arrays, boolean
 * - Each programming lang. has methods to parse and read it
